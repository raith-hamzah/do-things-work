# do things work?

## Raith Hamzah code test

This is a silly little todo-app designed to demonstrate some general react and coding profficiency. It features usage of react hooks like useReducer, useState, useEffect, useRef etc. All the css styles are written by me in plain css using BEM conventions and is responsive using a mobile first approach. The app is keyboard accessible, featuring focus styles with high contrast ratios and focus pulling for the form submissions. The markup features semantic DOM elements as well.

There is some data persistence through the use of indexedDb, the database available in newer browsers. The only library I brought in is dexie which is a small convenient promise wrapper around the indexedDb callback-based API. I also drew up some unit tests of the app's main reducer to display rudimentary testing competence.

I am hosting the app at [https://dothings.work](https://dothings.work).

Thanks for your consideration and best regards,
Raith
